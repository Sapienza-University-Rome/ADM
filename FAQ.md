This file is intended to gather the most relevant questions about the class. It happens many times that the same question is asked more than once. The latter becomes difficult to handle if we receive many emails asking for the same clarifications. 

According to the organization of the course, we suggest asking questions on Slack so that everyone can see our answers. At the same time, keeping track of all the threads in the channel might be challenging. For this reason, here we are!
