# Submit the homework

In this section, you find the instructions to submit your group assignment.

## When?
Homework 2 is due on [November 3rd at 23:59:59](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2024). Any homework submitted after the deadline will be subjected to a penalization with the following schema:

|   Delay  | Penalisation |
|:--------:|:------------:|
|  1 day |     -0.5     |
| 2 days |      -1      |
| 3 days |      -2      |
| 4 days |      -3      |
| 5 days |      -4      |

If you have particular problems respecting the deadline, please contact Aris directly (putting @Daniel in cc) and explain your situation clearly, mentioning your working group.


The maximum score you can get is 5.

## Where?
1. Each group must create __only one__ GitHub repository: follow these [steps](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-HW4/blob/master/README.md) (replace ADM-HW4 with the name you give to the repository). 

2. Before the deadline, you can push whatever you want in the repository. Any push after the deadline will be taken into account for the penalization.

__Note__ :

* The state of the repository at the deadline time corresponds to your submission.
* __[IMPORTANT]__ be sure to compile this [form](https://forms.gle/7XZ8yNaXc9MLQcCX6). **Only ONE PERSON per group must fill out the form**.

## What?

The content of the repository is up to you. The mandatory files are:

* `README.md`: a Markdown file that explains the content of your repository. This is an [example](https://github.com/CriMenghini/Wikipedia/tree/master/Mention). It is important that you state what each file/folder contains. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a cheatsheet to use Markdown.

* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that contains all the answers to your research and theoretical questions. The notebook must be clear, complete, and tidy. [Here](https://github.com/dusicastepic/ADMSecondHomework/blob/master/ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb) an example of a nice notebook from previous years.
    - In general, for the sake of the tidiness of the Notebook, you are encouraged to save your functions in external .py files that you [import](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules) in the notebook.
    - Upload on GitHub the notebook with the cells already run
    - It might be possible that you do not see some plots. For this reason, we suggest you put in the `README.md` a link that you create [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), just copying and pasting the URL of your notebook on GitHub.

It __must not__ contain:
* The datasets you used (thus, you should clearly state in the readme what dataset you used, if any, not in the homework description). That's because git allows you to push only datasets smaller than a maximum size. [Here](https://haydar-ai.medium.com/learning-how-to-git-ignoring-files-and-folders-using-gitignore-4b6a1ec43ce1) a good Medium's post that tells you how to deal with files/directories you do not want to push on GitHub.

## Post Homework

Each student will (randomly) need to fill out other 2 forms that will be published after the deadline of the homework:

1. [Individual Feedback - (deadline November 9th at 23:59:59](https://forms.gle/GPbxG7bRodt5KCGS9)): a form to express how you worked with your group and who did what (applicable only to those students who worked in groups).
2. [Peer Review  - (deadline November 9th at 23:59:59)](https://forms.gle/fphhvtYRTPzdU1wu7): you will receive an email containing 1 piece of homework that you have to review. You will find the guidelines for the review in the form. Please submit one different form for each repository that has been reviewed. Peer review is intended to help you develop your critical skills towards other people's work and to compare your work with that of others. 

You will have around __5 days (120 hours)__ to fill out the two forms after you have received the email with the corresponding repo to review. They are __mandatory__, i.e., we will not grade your homework if you don't fill out all the forms.
