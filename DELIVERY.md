# Homework Delivery 

To deliver every Homework, you __MUST__ complete __ALL__ the following steps. 

#### Group

The __entire group__ is responsible for these two steps. If at least one of these steps is not performed, we'll assume that the whole group will not deliver the Homework.

1) Fill out the form where you declare your group's GitHub repository. You can find it in each Homework's [`README.md`] file. The latter must be done __as soon as possible__, and of course __BEFORE__ the deadline of the given Homework. __N.b.__: we need __only one__ filled form per group. 

2) __Complete the Homework!__ To check if the Homework was submitted on time, we'll consider the __last__ commit. Thus __do not__ make any commit after the deadline unless you need more time to complete the tasks (remember that for delays, the policy on [`README.md`] of each Homework will hold). 

__N.b.__: If you need more time to complete the Homework, please contact ASAP any of the TAs, declaring it before the deadline. 

#### Individual

For these steps, each one of you is responsible for himself. If at least one of these steps is not performed in __5 days (120 hours)__ after the deadline, we'll not consider your Homework as delivered, even if it exists and is well done.

3) __Individual review__: you need to fill in this form to tell us about your experience with your team-mates. The latter helps to give the proper credit to the ones of you who have worked hard for this Homework.

4) __Peer Review__: you need to fill in this form, in which you make the review of a random homework of your colleagues. More details are in the [`EVALUATION.md`](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/blob/master/EVALUATION.md) file.


All required forms will be available in each Homework folder at the end of the [`README.md`] file.

For any questions regarding the delivery, Slack one of the TAs!

Good luck!
