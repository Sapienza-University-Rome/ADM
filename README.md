# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining (ADM) 

Hi everyone,

Here, you will find the collection of homework for the ADM class of the MSc. in Data Science @ Sapienza University. For each year, you will see the respective assignments.

In particular, for each assignment, you find a sub-directory that contains:

- `README.md` that describes the task
- `SUBMIT.md` that contains the deadline and the deliverables. You can also find the needed forms for the delivery (usually updated a few days before the deadline)!

## Take a look at
- [`EVALUATION.md`](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/blob/master/EVALUATION.md): How peer evaluation works
- [`DELIVERY.md`](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/blob/master/DELIVERY.md): Submitting policy
- [`FAQ.md`](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/blob/master/FAQ.md): Frequently asked questions while working in groups.


## Collaborations
According to the policy presented by Aris and Federico, we encourage you to ask questions to your colleagues before asking to the TAs team. As you will be informed by the TAs team, __Slack__ is a powerful resource to have an answer to your questions, so use it! Remember that participating in a debate is always an excellent way to practice.

## Office hours
Since some TAs work remotely and you will have classes at different buildings, TAs will not have office hours. Nonetheless, we will constantly be available on Slack to answer any of your questions, and if you are struggling and having a lot of trouble with the homework, you ask on Slack to organize office hours for the entire class, and this will be set up at DIAG, via Ariosto 25. During office hours, TAs will answer your questions and clarify unclear parts of the homework.

## Register to the course
To register for the course, participate in the assignments, access the Slack channel, and receive official communications. To register you must email Professor Aris Anagnostopoulos (aris@diag.uniroma1.it).
